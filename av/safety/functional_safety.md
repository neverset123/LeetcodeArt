## Functional Safety
![](../../docs/img/ISO26262.PNG)
functional safety and ISO 26262 do not consider all risk in E/E systems. They only consider reducing risk as a result of malfunctioning behavior of E/E systems(no other safety and normal performance are considered in FUSA, normal performace is related to SOTIF in  ISO 21448). Functional safety focuses on keeping risks below society's current threshold. ISO 26262 compliance is not legally required, but a standard way to ensure a safe EE system.

- identify hazards
Take a machine learning algorithm as an example. What happens if a pedestrian training set does not include pedestrians in wheelchairs? The system would not count a pedestrian in a wheelchair. How accurate do our results need to be on a validation set? Who determines what the training set needs to contain?
- evaluate the risk
Automotive Safety Integrity Level. ASIL is a four point scale of ASIL A, ASIL B, ASIL C and ASIL D. And one more level of risk below ASIL A called QM.
- using systems engineering to lower risk


## requirements
- Functional requirements generally have the form X system shall do Y. For example, "The turn signal system shall turn on an indicator light telling the driver that the system is active".

- Non-functional requirements have the form X system shall be Y. As an example: "The turn signal system shall be available when the vehicle ignition switch is in the on position".
